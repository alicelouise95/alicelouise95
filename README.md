# Hey there! 👋

I'm Alice, originally from Cornwall, UK 🏖️, now living in Malmö, Sweden 🇸🇪.  

I have experience in iOS development, and one of my public projects is [SwiftySudoku](https://github.com/alicelouise95/SwiftySudoku), a Sudoku app I developed in Swift.  

Recently, I discovered my passion for cybersecurity and have been diving deep into the field.
