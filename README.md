# Hey there! 👋

I'm Alice, originally from Cornwall, UK 🏖️, now living in Malmö, Sweden 🇸🇪.  

I have experience in iOS development, and one of my public projects is [SwiftySudoku](https://github.com/alicelouise95/SwiftySudoku), a Sudoku app I developed in Swift.  

Recently, I discovered my passion for cybersecurity and have been diving deep into the field. I'm currently working through the TryHackMe roadmap, starting with [Pre-Security](https://github.com/alicelouise95/tryhackme-writeups-Pre-Security) and now progressing through [Cybersecurity 101](https://github.com/alicelouise95/TryHackMe-writeups-Cybersecurity101). My goal is to earn the Network+ certificate, gain hands-on experience, and eventually move into offensive security - penetration testing and red teaming.  

You can connect with me via my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alice-w-4742b5280/) or explore my portfolio [here](https://alicedev.my.canva.site/).  

Thanks for stopping by! 🌟
