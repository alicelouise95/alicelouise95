# Hey there! 👋

I'm Alice, originally from Cornwall, UK 🏖️, and currently doing an internship, working with iOS development! 📱

### My Recent iOS Project: Orison 🙏

🌟 **Orison** For my iOS project during my studies, I developed Orison. Orison is a Christian prayer app that makes your spiritual journey more meaningful and personal. 

🙌 Orison generates heartfelt prayers based on your preferences and needs. Whether you seek comfort, guidance, or simply want to express gratitude, Orison has your back.
